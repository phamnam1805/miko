# Miko Project

A hands-on learning project for Kubernetes and Cilium networking. This repository contains various configurations and examples to explore container orchestration, service mesh, and advanced networking concepts.

## Project Overview

Miko serves as a practical playground for learning:
- **Kubernetes fundamentals** - Deployments, Services, StatefulSets, and more
- **Cilium networking** - Advanced CNI features, ingress, and security policies
- **Container orchestration** - Real-world application deployment patterns

## Directory Structure
